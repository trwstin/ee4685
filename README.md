# Red Wine Quality
This project aims to compare the performance of different Bayesian and non-Bayesian models in predicting wine quality from measured physi-chemical features. To achieve this, we implemented four classifier models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Empirical Bayes, and Naive Bayes. We trained and evaluated these models on the Portuguese wine quality dataset produced by Paulo Cortez 

**Course:** Machine learning, a Bayesian Perspective (TU Delft, EE4685)

## Dataset
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1. fixed acidity
2. volatile acidity
3. citric acid
4. residual sugar
5. chlorides
6. free sulfur dioxide
7. total sulfur dioxide
8. 8. density
9. pH
10. sulphates
11. alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):

12. quality (score between 0 and 10)
